      <h2>Brian Tu</h2>
      <p>
        I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the
        University of Waterloo. My interest in computer science came from
        hackathons that allowed me to realize the impact technology has to
        change the future. I strive to continue building and designing products
        through internships, side projects, and hackathons. When I'm not coding,
        you may find me biking or playing the guitar!
